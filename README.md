# Libraries-in-C++
This repository contains several libraries written as part of an educational programming course. Libraries are implemented through classes and structures; CMake is also used to build projects and use libraries in test programs.

At the moment, libraries have been implemented for:
- complex numbers with a full range of arithmetic operations on them;
- rational (fractional) numbers with a full range of arithmetic operations;
- dynamic arrays with a basic set of operations;

Language: C++
